[ISSUE 1] Fix for Latest Financial Health Data Download Method
- Issue: For example, with stock code 005930, although its quarterly report was updated on May 17th and the DART system confirmed this, my data collection algorithm that ran immediately afterward couldn't retrieve the latest data.
- Possible Cause: This could be due to the timing of the actual data upload within the DART API system. When I ran the same algorithm later, it worked fine.
- Current Limitation: My code currently assumes that data is updated without verifying if an update has actually occurred.
- Proposed Solution: I may implement an algorithm that confirms whether the data is truly updated or not before proceeding.

=> Implemented Solution (check if working)
- Introduced DAYS_ALLOWANCE = 2
- Code searches updated codes only up to DAYS_ALLOWANCE days before today
- date_updated column in DB is also recorded to DAYS_ALLOWANCE days before today


[ISSUE 2] Data collection for companies whose fiscal year does not end in December
- It seems the quarterly data gathering for such companies could be wrong
- in dart.finstate, the following code_dict could mean different for such companies 
    reprt_code_dict = {1: '11013', 2: '11012', 3: '11014', 4: '11011'}
- Current code only works well with December companies
