- module search path: 

    import sys
    sys.path
    sys.path.append() # adding at the runtime


- executing module as a script

    __name__ == "__main__"


- packages

    a package is a set of module
    it provides a namespace
    from <package> import <module>
    if only an package is imported, the subordinated modules are not automatically imported
    previously, '__init__.py' has to be located in an package(probably in Django migrations it still does...), but no longer required


- '-m' option in python
    
    python -m enables to run a module (no need to put .py)
    (1) execute python code from the command line via modulename rather than filename 
    (2) add a directory to sys.path for use in import resolution and 
    (3) execute python code that contains relative imports from the command line. 


- Package in the pypi
    pip install <package>
    this package is different from the package of moudles described above (more close to distribution)
    there are certain rules to upload a package in pypi, then users can use the package through pip


- OAuth

    lets a service to use a user's information available in 3rd parties without using the user's credentials for the 3rd parties
    instead it uses access tokens
