- module search path: 
    import sys
    sys.path
    sys.path.append() # adding at the runtime


- executing module as a script
    __name__ == "__main__"
    Wrap your multiprocessing code in an if __name__ == '__main__': block in your main script to ensure that it's only executed in the main process. This helps avoid issues with creating child processes during import.
    i.e., better in process management with the OS


- packages
    a package is a set of module
    it provides a namespace
    from <package> import <module>
    if only an package is imported, the subordinated modules are not automatically imported
    previously, '__init__.py' has to be located in an package(probably in Django migrations it still does...), but no longer required


- '-m' option in python
    python -m enables to run a module (no need to put .py)
    (1) execute python code from the command line via modulename rather than filename 
    (2) add a directory to sys.path for use in import resolution and 
    (3) execute python code that contains relative imports from the command line. 


- Package in the pypi
    pip install <package>
    this package is different from the package of moudles described above (more close to distribution)
    there are certain rules to upload a package in pypi, then users can use the package through pip


- OAuth
    lets a service to use a user's information available in 3rd parties without using the user's credentials for the 3rd parties
    instead it uses access tokens


- TMUX
    sudo apt-get install tmux; probably already installed in Ubuntu
    enable virtualenv... then...
    tmux new -s <process_name>
    run code
    ctrl+b, d (detatch)

    tmux ls
    tmux attach -t <process_name>
    exit
    tmux kill-session -t <process_name>

- git 
    git add . <- . means current directory and subordinated directories
    git add -A <- adds all from base directory



### 

- installations
    pip install -U finance-datareader
    pip install opendartreader 
    pip install pyarrow
    pip install scipy



### Changes need to make in installations

- in mojito module, change path to the token.dat to be in config...

- in fdr, for file \FinanceDataReader\krx\listing.py: 
    df_listing = pd.read_html(url, header=0, encoding='euc-kr')[0]  # Use 'euc-kr' encoding
